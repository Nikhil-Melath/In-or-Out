# In or Out - A Cricket Command Line Game

Welcome to "In or Out," a simple command-line cricket game written in Python. This game simulates a simplified version of cricket, where the user competes against the computer in a thrilling match.

## Features

- **Toss:** At the start of the game, a toss is conducted. The winner of the toss gets to choose whether to bat or bowl first.

- **Batting and Bowling:** The user and the computer take turns either batting or bowling. The user enters a number between 1 and 6, and the computer generates a random number in the same range.

- **Wickets:** If both the user and the computer enter the same number, it results in a wicket. The player who was batting gets out, and the roles switch.

- **Scoring:** The game keeps track of the score, and the player with the highest score at the end wins.
